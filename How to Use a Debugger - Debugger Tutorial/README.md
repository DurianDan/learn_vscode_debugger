### The debugger will stop at the break point.
- It will stop untill all the code required by that break point has finished.

### The call stack
- Is the different places (functions, classes, modules, etc.) outside of current breakpoint.
- Will tell you how the breakpoint calls other functions, and how those functions call others as well.

### Watch
- Write an expression, it will show changes of that expression everytime a step is made.

### Variables
- Show changes in Global and Local variables (when the steps are in a particular class or function).
